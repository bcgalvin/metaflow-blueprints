# Metaflow Blueprints

**Metaflow Blueprints** is a framework for defining event sources for triggering Metaflow runs in a CDK-esq way, following concepts that power other CDK frameworks such as [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), [CDKTF](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk), and [CDK8s](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s). This project currently is in an alpha state and there may be breaking changes as it is developed.
